# QMK Firmware

This files are not merged to official QMK repository, but you can build the firmware locally using this files.

I confirmed successfully building on below environments:

- QMK Firmware 0.22.14
- vial-qmk f06a05a
- Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS on WSL2 on Windows 11 22H2

To build the firmware using this files, please refer [vial-qmk Porting Guide](https://get.vial.today/docs/porting-to-vial.html).
